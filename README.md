OK, first you need to go to vscode folder, in my case i use linux xubuntu my path to the folder is (/home/user/.config/Code/User/snippets/).
After this, we have two choices - You can clone this repo in this folder, or you can create a new snippet ( i'll show you how to do this )

Creating a new snippet.
#1 - After opening the vscode press the keys - ctrl + shift + p to open this menu
