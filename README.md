<p>OK, first you need to go to vscode folder, in my case i use linux xubuntu my path to the folder is (/home/user/.config/Code/User/snippets/).
After this, we have two choices - You can clone this repo in this folder, or you can create a new snippet ( i'll show you how to do this )</p>

## Creating a new snippet.
<p>#1 - After opening the vscode press the keys - ctrl + shift + p to open this menu on the top of vscode. </p>

<p>#2 - Type snippets and click in this first option (Preferences: Configure User Snippet). </p>

<p>#2.1 - Type a name for your snippet file (i recommend use the name of the programming language what are you using (Python, ReactJS, JS, Java, etc...)). In this case i'll use ReactJS to show you.</p>
<p>#3 - After you made this, a file will be created named (reactjs.code-snippets (in this case...)). You can delete all these comments.</p>

<p>#4 - Ok, in this step to make it easy we'll use this website (https://snippet-generator.app/).</p>
<p>For example: I want to make this code below in a second.</p>

<p>#5 - We'll paste this code in this website.</p>

<p>#6 - Copy and paste this code generated in your file created before.</p>

<p>And finally you only need to use snippet prefix.</p>

<p>You can customize it better than it, you can check in the vscode oficial site. (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets).
